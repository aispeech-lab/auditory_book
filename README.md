# 听觉系统与鸡尾酒会问题 (The Auditory System at the Cocktail Party)   
    The Auditory System at the Cocktail Party is a rather whimsical title that points to the very serious challenge 
    faced by listeners in most everyday environments: how to hear out sounds of interest amid a cacophony of 
    competing sounds. The volume presents the mechanisms for bottom-up object formation and top-down object selection 
    that the auditory system employs to meet that challenge.
